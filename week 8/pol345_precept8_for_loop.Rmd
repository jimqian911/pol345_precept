Welcome! This document contains materials that would be helpful for week 8 of POL 345. Specifically, we will cover two important control structures in programming: *for loop* and *if statement*, as well as the *K-Means* algorithm. 

In this document, we will focus on the *for loop*.

### 1. For loop^[Some materials from https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/for-loop/] 

#### 1.1 Basic Idea of for loop

A lot of times, you might want to repeat a specific block of code for each element in a vector, or each row/column in a dataframe/matrix, etc. The *for loop* is a widely-used control structure to complete this kind of task without copy-and-paste the same chunk of code again and again. 

The basic syntax of *for loop* is as the following:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
for (val in sequence){
  statement
}
```

In the chunk above:
  
  - `sequence` is a vector contains elements to be iterated in the loop.
  - `val` is a "placeholder", which will take on the value of each element in `seuqnce`, and would be used in the block of code in `statement`.
  - `statement` is the block of code to be executed repeatedly during the loop.

Below is an example of a basic for loop:

```{r}
x = 1:10
for (i in x){
  print(i)
}
```

As you can see, in the example above, `sequence` is now the object `x`, which is a numerical vector contains ten integers: {1, 2, ..., 10}. `i` is the "placeholder" (`val`). And the `statement` is simply `print(i)`. In this loop, `i` takes each value in the vector `x`, then the code `print(i)` is executed. 

The basic structure of the for loop can be illustrated in the following figure:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-for-loop.jpg")
```

#### 1.2 Examples of for loop in different cases

In the example above, we loop over each element in `sequence` and also do some operations with that element. A common situation involving for loop is to loop over a vector of *indices*, and use that to iteratively extract each element from another object. For example:

```{r}
y = c("A", "B", "C", "D")
for (i in 1:length(y)){
  print(y[i])
}
```

Here, the vector to be looped over is `1:length(y)` which is a numerical vector of four elements: `c(1, 2, 3, 4)`. Instead of doing any operation with these numbers, we loop over this vector to extract the corresponding element from the vector `y`, which contains four characters: `c("A", "B", "C", "D")`, and use square brackets to extract the 1th, 2nd, ... element from the vector `y`. 

Similarly, we can also loop over each row or column from a dataframe/matrix. Again, by using square brackets:

```{r}
congress = read.csv("data/congress.csv",
                    stringsAsFactors = F)
congress_head = congress[1:10, ] #The first 10 rows from the congress dataset

#Loop over each row
for (i in 1:nrow(congress_head)){
  print(congress_head[i, ])
}

#Loop over each column
for (i in 1:ncol(congress_head)){
  print(congress_head[, i])
}
```

Of course, in very rare cases would we want to loop over a certain object and print out each of the element. The block of code (`sequence`) could be any operation that you want to do.

#### 1.3 Store results from for loop

A lot of times, we want to *store* the results from a for loop. In order to do so, we often create a *container*, which is an empty object, and put the result from each iteration of the for loop inside the corresponding element of that container. For example:

```{r}
#Say we calculate the area of circles with different semidiameters

r = c(1, 3, 4, 5, 6) #a vector of the semidiameters of five circles
area = c() #The "container" (an empty vector) to store the calculated areas

#Let's write a for loop to calculate the area of each circle:
for (i in 1:length(r)){
  area[i] = pi * r[i]^2
}

print(area)
```

In the example above, we calculated the area of five different circles, with their semidiameters stored in the vector `r`. In order to do so, we loop over each element in `r`, and store the calculated area in the vector `area`. It's worth mentioning that, although we could directly loop over the vector `r` by using `for (i in r)`, this would be problematic when we want to store the results in the vecttor `area`. Therefore, loop over a vector of indices and extract the value from the `r` with indexing could help us to conveiently store the results.
